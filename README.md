## :star2: About the Project
A project made in accordance with the FdF project for the Codam Core Curriculum.
An intro to working with graphics. With FdF you transform a grid of numbers into a 3D graphic wire mesh.
You use a graphics library to make a looping program to display a wire frame mesh. Which with the bonus can also move around, zoom and rotate.
I used [W2Wizard's](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42) remake of the MLX library.
